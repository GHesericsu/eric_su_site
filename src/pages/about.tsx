          I was born in the Midwest USA and grew up in Taiwan until I was 16.
          Then I left my family to go back to the US for high school and
          University. I studied finance and economics and love it. After
          finishing my last university class and without going to the graduation
          ceremony, I hastily put all my stuff into a van and moved to NYC. Bye
          bye Indiana. I spent the next 8 years networking and building a life
          in NYC.
